This is a python3 web app designed to meet the Jubilant Pancake code test. It'll take two strings from the front end, and pass them to the back end.

I'm excited to get back into the python world, but probably will make a couple mistakes along the way, which I'll hopefully correct and account for.

So far, decided to use flask for a basic json web server.  
Although the I'm going to give the create-react-app tool for spinning up an easy react ui, although most of my experience is really in the regular js/jquery/angular world



To run:
* pipenv shell
* FLASK_APP=server.py flask run
and go to localhost:5000
