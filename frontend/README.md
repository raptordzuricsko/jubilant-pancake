react front end piece for jubilant pancake. I'm still improving my react skills, but thought it'd be fun to do it for this challenge.

run npm server in dev mode with "npm start", which will watch the source files and set up the server at the default localhost:3000. It'll make an http request to the backend server at the default localhost:5000, and tell you the result.

There's a default code test in here - If I had a little bit more time to mess around with it I'd probably start there and add some coverage.

Additionally, I'd spend a bit more time on the styling.
